Internal guidebook of the Mindful Meerkats collective
=======

Hi there,

Welcome to Mindful Meerkats. You're likely reading this because you want to be part of the Mindful Meerkats collective. Well, that sounds great! In order to make our lives easier, we created this guidebook to help you get started in the collective.

Everything sorted? Great, let's jump on the into the savanna grass!
